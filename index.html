<div class="textblock"><h1>GalSim: The modular galaxy image simulation toolkit </h1>
<p>GalSim is open-source software for simulating images of astronomical objects (stars, galaxies) in a variety of ways. The bulk of the calculations are carried out in C++, and the user interface is in python. In addition, the code can operate directly on "config" files, for those users who prefer not to work in python. The impetus for the software package was a weak lensing community data challenge, called GREAT3: </p>
<pre class="fragment">http://great3challenge.info/
</pre><p>However, the code has numerous additional capabilities beyond those needed for the challenge, and has been useful for a number of projects that needed to simulate high-fidelity galaxy images with accurate sizes and shears. At the end of this file, there is a list of the code capabilities and plans for future development.</p>
<h2>Distribution </h2>
<p>The current released version of GalSim is version 1.0. To get the code, you can grab the tarball (or zip file) from </p>

<pre class="fragment">http://stackoverflow.com/
</pre><p>Some of the GalSim developers have alerts set up to be automatically notified about questions with the 'galsim' tag, so there is a good chance that your question will be answered.</p>
<p>If you find something that you think is a bug, or if you have a suggestion for a new feature, please open up an Issue on our GitHub repository: </p>
<pre class="fragment">https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim/issues?state=open
</pre><h2>Installation </h2>
<p>For installation instructions, please see the file <code><a class="el" href="_i_n_s_t_a_l_l_8md.html">INSTALL.md</a></code> in the main repository directory.</p>
<p>There are tagged versions of the code corresponding to specific project releases and development milestones. (For more info, see the "Tagged versions" section below, and <code>devel/git.txt</code>)</p>
<h2>Getting started </h2>
<ul>
<li>Install the code as in <code><a class="el" href="_i_n_s_t_a_l_l_8md.html">INSTALL.md</a></code>.</li>
<li>Optional, but recommended whenever you try a new version of the code: run the unit tests to make sure that there are no errors. You can do this by running <code>scons tests</code>. If there are any issues, please open an Issue on our GitHub page.</li>
<li>Optional: run <code>doxygen</code> to generate documentation, using <code>Doxyfile</code> in the main repository directory to specify all doxygen settings. Alternatively, you can view the documentation online at <pre class="fragment">http://galsim-developers.github.com/GalSim/
</pre></li>
</ul>
<h2>Reference documentation </h2>
<p>For an overview of GalSim workflow and python tools, please see <code>doc/GalSim_Quick_Reference.pdf</code> in the GalSim repository. A guide to using the configuration files to generate simulations, a FAQ for installation issues, and other useful references can be found on the GalSim wiki, </p>
<pre class="fragment">https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim/wiki
</pre><p>More thorough documentation for all parts of the code can be found in the doxygen documentation mentioned in the previous section, or in the python docstrings in <code>galsim/*.py</code>.</p>
<h2>Repository directory structure </h2>
<p>The repository has a number of subdirectories. Below is a guide to their contents:</p>
<ul>
<li>bin/ : executables (after the compilation procedure is done).</li>
<li>devel/ : an assortment of developer tools.</li>
<li>doc/ : documentation, including a <code>Quick Reference</code> guide and, if the user generates doxygen documentation using Doxyfile, the outputs will also go in this directory.</li>
<li>examples/ : example scripts (see the following section).</li>
<li>galsim/ : the python code for GalSim (which is what most end-users interact with).</li>
<li>include/ : the .h header files for the C++ parts of GalSim.</li>
<li>lib/ : compiled libraries (after the compilation procedure is done).</li>
<li>pysrc/ : the code that makes the purely C++ parts of GalSim accessible to the python layer of GalSim.</li>
<li>src/ : the source code for the purely C++ parts of GalSim.</li>
<li>tests/ : unit tests.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Demonstration scripts </h2>
<p>There are a number of scripts in <code>examples/</code> that demonstrate how the code can be used. These are called <code>demo1.py</code>...<code>demo11.py</code>. You can run them by typing (e.g.) <code>python demo1.py</code> while sitting in <code>examples/</code>, All demo scripts are designed to be run in the <code>examples/</code> directory. Some of them access files in subdirectories of the <code>examples/</code> directory, so they would not work correctly from other locations.</p>
<p>A completely parallel sequence of configuration files, called <code>demo1.yaml</code>... <code>demo11.yaml</code>, demonstrates how to make the same set of simulations using config files that are parsed by the executable <code>bin/galsim</code>.</p>
<p>As the project develops through further versions, and adds further capabilities to the software, more demo scripts may be added to <code>examples/</code> to illustrate what GalSim can do.</p>
<h2>Additional scripts </h2>
<p>There are some additional scripts in the <code>examples/</code> directory as well. These utilities take various command-line arguments, which are explained in comments at the top of each file.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ShootInterpolated.py</code> is a script that takes as input a filename for a FITS image, which it will simulate (optionally sheared and/or resampled) via photon-shooting.</li>
<li><code>MeasMoments.py</code> can be used to measure the adaptive moments (best-fit elliptical Gaussian) for a FITS image.</li>
<li><code>MeasShape.py</code> can be used to carry out PSF correction using one of four methods, given FITS images of the galaxy and PSF.</li>
<li><code>des.py</code> creates an image based on DES PSF estimates using DES catalogs as input. It is primarily designed to demonstrate the usage of the des module, and is accompanies by a config file, <code>des.yaml</code> that does the same thing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tagged versions </h2>
<p>Each GalSim release is tagged in git with the tag name <code>vX.X.X</code>. You can see the available tags using the command </p>
<pre class="fragment">git tag -l
</pre><p>at a terminal from within the repository. In addition to the official releases, we also have tags for various other milestones that were important at one time or another.</p>
<p>The version of the code at any given snapshot can be downloaded from our GitHub webpage, or checked out from the repository using the tag name, e.g.: </p>
<pre class="fragment">git checkout v1.0.0
</pre><p>This will then update your directory tree to the snapshot of the code at the milestone requested. (You will also get a message about being in a "detached" HEAD state. That is normal.)</p>
<p>For a version history and a description of how the current version of the code differs from the last tagged version, see <a class="el" href="_h_i_s_t_o_r_y_8md.html">HISTORY.md</a> and <a class="el" href="_c_h_a_n_g_e_l_o_g_8md.html">CHANGELOG.md</a> (respectively). These files are found in the main GalSim directory, and are also displayed on our wiki which is linked above.</p>
<h2>Summary of current capabilities </h2>
<p>Currently, GalSim has the following capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can generate PSFs from a variety of simple parametric models such as Moffat, Kolmogorov, and Airy, as well as an optical PSF model that includes Zernike aberrations up to spherical, and an optional central obscruration and struts.</li>
<li>Can simulate galaxies from a variety of simple parametric models as well as from real HST data. For information about downloading a suite of COSMOS images, see <pre class="fragment">https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim/wiki/RealGalaxy%20Data
</pre></li>
<li>Can make the images either via i) Fourier transform, ii) real-space convolution (real-space being occasionally faster than Fourier), or iii) photon-shooting. The exception is that objects that include a deconvolution (such as RealGalaxy objects) must be carried out using Fourier methods only.</li>
<li>Can apply shear, magnification, dilation, or rotation to a galaxy profile including lensing-based models from a power spectrum or NFW halo profile.</li>
<li>Can draw galaxy images into arbitrary locations within a larger image.</li>
<li>Can add noise using a variety of noise models, including correlated noise.</li>
<li>Can whiten existing correlated noise that is already in an image.</li>
<li>Can read in input values from a catalog, a dictionary file (such as a JSON or YAML file), or a fits header.</li>
<li>Can write images in a variety of formats: regular FITS files, FITS data cubes, or multi-extension FITS files. It can also compress the output files using various compressions including gzip, bzip2, and rice.</li>
<li>Can carry out nearly any simulation that a user might want using two parallel methods: directly using python code, or by specifying the simulation properties in an input configuration script. See the demo scripts in the examples/ directory for examples of each.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary of planned future development </h2>
<p>We plan to add the following additional capabilities in future versions of GalSim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for generic world coordinate systems (WCS). (cf. Issue #364)</li>
<li>PSFs from stochastic atmosphere models. (cf. devel/modules/atmos_factfinding.pdf)</li>
<li>Simulating simple detector defects or image artifacts.</li>
<li>Support for flexion. (cf. Issue #361)</li>
<li>Support for chromatic effects. (cf. Issue #467)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many others as well. Please see </p>
<pre class="fragment">https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim/issues
</pre><p>for a list of the current open issues. And feel free to add an issue if there is something useful that you think should be possible, but is not currently implemented. </p>
